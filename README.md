## 🎯 Description

**CodoBookings** is a lightweight yet powerful **WordPress booking management plugin** designed for developers and site owners who want complete flexibility.  
Originally built as a Paid Memberships Pro (PMPro) extension, it has now evolved into a **standalone booking engine**, providing the foundation for managing appointments, schedules, and customer interactions — **without requiring any dependencies**.

Future extensions (coming soon) will seamlessly integrate with:
- 🧩 **Paid Memberships Pro** (membership-based bookings)
- 🛒 **WooCommerce** (sell bookings as products)
- 📅 **Google Calendar** (sync bookings with personal or business calendars)
- 💬 **Email & Notifications** (customized reminders, confirmations, and admin alerts)
